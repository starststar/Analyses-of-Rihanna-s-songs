# Analyses-of-Rihanna-s-songs
This solution will analyze the anger in Rihanna’s top Billboard songs. The top songs were only those that ended up on the year-end top 100 Billboard chart. Songs can be on the weekly top 100 charts, yet they never make it to the yearly top 100. The yearly top 100 chart is only for the best songs from the weekly top 100. I also analyzed the words she uses the most. 

Artist selection – Rihanna was chosen because within the last twenty-five years ending in 2017, she has more top 100 songs than any other artist. 

Sources - Songs were sourced from Wikipedia. Lyrics were sourced from MetroLyrics.com, SongLyrics.com, and LyricsMode.com. Album names were manually inputted. I tried to get them from Spotify, but I never had enough time to fix the coding problems, which I encountered.

Analyses – The most popular words used in all her songs were counted. The most popular word-pairs (two words) were also counted. The average level of anger in each song and record was calculated. 

Two Charts - The first chart that shows the most popular word-pairs used by Rihanna in each of her songs. The second chart shows her anger in her songs, it shows her anger per song and album.  

I calculated the anger in each song by using the NRC classification.

Album images were added to the dataset but they are not showing. The next code update will enable the images to show in the graph.

In this dataset “Bitch better have my money” is the song with the most anger by Rihanna.

The most used pair of words by Rihanna in her songs is “yeah yeah”, second is “la la”, and third is “come on”.
